## Anticheat Notes
- Intave is used by servers like MCCentral / Herobrine.org / universocraft / Gamster.

## How to detect
- First transaction will be -32768
- Second transaction will be -32767
- Third transaction will be -32766
- Intave usually doesnt go above -32740 with transaction uid unless you get flagged a lot
- Intave will rarely send transactions if you aren't near an entity
- Can be checked for by typing /iac, /iac verbose and /iac alerts
