## Anticheat Notes
- Atomic is a private non-prediction anticheat with barely any checks.

## How to detect
- It WILL false a lot.
- As far as i know, No transactions are sent.
- Only supports 1.19.4, So just check if the server is 1.19.4.
- Lagbacks work by simply moving you to your previous location(s) stored in a hashmap.
