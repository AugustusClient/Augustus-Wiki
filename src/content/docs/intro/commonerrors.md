#### Login failed Invalid HWID
Your HWID changed and you have to reset it. You get your own HWID reset every 14 day. You can do the change on your own in the designated HWID change tab in the launcher. After you did that there will be the 14 day HWID reset cooldown. 
That cooldown can be reset by admins when making a ticket and explaining why you need another one
