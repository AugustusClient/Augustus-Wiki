title: AutoEat
description: Automatically eats food for you when you are hungry
---

This feature allows you to automate eating food while traveling on the map, so you will waste less food and always be full.

### Sliders MinHunger and MaxHunger
Allows you to adjust from what hunger point you want the character to eat food. (From 1 to 20)

### UseGapple
This mode also eats golden apples (and no, it doesn't work like the Autogapple module), it just happens that the player has nothing from food but gapples and if you don't want to save, you can turn it on

### NotWhileKillaura
With this function, food is simply not eaten automatically during the killaura, which does not bother you

### NotWhileScaffold
Works the same as with NotWhileKillaura, it just doesn't eat food during the scaffold.
