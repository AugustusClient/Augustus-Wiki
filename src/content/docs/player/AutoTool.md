This function allows you to automate the selection of tools and sword, which allows you to avoid unnecessary actions and achieve your goal faster.

## Tools
If enabled, it will select the necessary tools that you have to break the block.

## Sword
If enabled, it will select a sword to hit a player or mob

#### MinDelayBeforeSwitch and MaxDelayBeforeSwitch
Allows you to set a delay before picking up a certain tool

#### MinDelayAtItemSwitch and MaxDelayAtItemSwitch
delay when you have already switched to a certain tool to perform an action

#### MinBackSwitchDelay and MaxBackSwitchDelay
Allows you to adjust the delay to return to your previous slot (Correct me if I explained it wrong somehow)

### NotInARow
Each delay has this function, it can slow down the action a little, but will allow you to bypass more anti-cheats

## OnlyAtSneak
Works when you're in sneak

## Silent
Doesn't show you switching to some tool that doesn't distract you (it seems to bypass all anti-cheats, but always check just in case)
