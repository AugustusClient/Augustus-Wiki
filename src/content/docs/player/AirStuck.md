This function can save you in different situations, for example, on some anti-cheats it will allow you to return even to the point from which you fell, on some you will simply hang and be able to throw a pearl somewhere, and also you can simply mock the players since in the entrance they will not be able to reach you

# Modes

#### Intave
Allows you to bypass anti-cheat intave, you can hang in the air and it works for a long time, I timed it and it took 1 hour, maybe it works infinitely

#### NoRotate
This mode does not allow the character to spin, which bypasses anti-cheats, the fact that you can look around is visual!

#### CanRotate
In this mode you can already rotate the camera, but this does not allow you to bypass good anti-cheats that check this, so be careful!

#### NewNoRotate
A newer and more advanced mode that allows you to bypass more anti-cheats

# Result

This function bypasses a huge number of anti-cheats and is useful, it is up to you to decide which mod to use, in general I checked and many bypassed
