description: Automatically throws an ender pearl for teleportation when falling into void
---

This function should save you by automatically throwing the pearl to a place where it will be safe and you will not fall (This function is not perfect and it may have bugs and lags)

### Auto airstuck
Automatically freezes you in mid-air so that the pearl can fly to a safe location.

### Unstuck if combatPearl didn't land
Works in combination with the CombatPearl function and unfreezes the player in the air if the pearl does not reach

### Only if player is falling into the void
I think it will be clear from the description of the function name

### Auto disable
Automatically disables AutoEnderPearl if it has completed its function
