title: AutoExtinguish
description: Automatically extinguishes the player with a bucket of water
---

This function extinguishes the player with a bucket of water, a very useful function because it is not necessary to perform unnecessary actions

### MinVertical speed and MaxVertical speed
Allows you to set the rotation speed for performing the action, the more you set the value, the faster it is performed

### NotInARow
It might slow extinguish down a bit, but it will allow you to bypass more anti-cheats if they react to it.

### RandomizeYaw
Randomizes rotations which allows you to bypass more anti-cheats (recommended)

### NotWhileKillaura
Will not perform actions while Killaura is enabled (useful to not interfere in combat)
