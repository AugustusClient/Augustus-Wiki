ExploitFixer fixes certain Exploits that are present in Minecraft

## ResourcePack
Servers are able to scan throught your files via certain resourcepack exploits.

(This was tested on a test server, Diona is not a part of Augustus)
- Example: This would show up if you dont have ExploitFixer with ResourcePack enabled

- When ExploitFixer is enabled with ResourcePack

## ParticleCrash
Lets you set the max Particles for the Client to render to midigate Crashes. Everything above set threshold will not be shown

## VelocityCrasher
Servers are able to send massiv velocity packets to your client that crash your game. This fixes that issue

## ExplosionCrasher
Prevents the server from spawning to many explosions that could crash you

## RainCrasher
Prevents the server to spawn to much rain to crash you

## FireworkCrasher
Prevents the server from spawning to many fireworks to crash you

## MoveSpeedCrash
Similar to VelocityCrash

## BlockEndScreen
I dont know this one atm

## DemoScreenFix
I dont know this one atm

## SignCrash
i dont know this one atm

## Hycraft
Hycraft used to crash people that where banned. Simply said they made cheaters crash and banned them based on that. So if you crashed you got banned. Legits couldnt be crashed. Hycraft in ExploitFixer goes around that crashing making it a somewhat "ban disabler" As of now it doesnt seem if hycraft does that stuff anymore
