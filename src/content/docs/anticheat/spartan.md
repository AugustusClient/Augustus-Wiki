## Anticheat Notes
- Ahh Spartan.

## How to detect
- Spartans flags are strange.
- Usually you can check if it's Spartan by flying slowing high above the ground and seeing if it lags you back up then down towards the ground (or vice versa).
- Can be checked for by typing /spartan, /spartan notifications
