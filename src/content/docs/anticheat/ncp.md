title: NCP

## Anticheat Notes
- It's NCP. Enough said.

## How to detect
- NCP will always lag you back onto your last ground position unless the server has something else to drag you down. 
- The easiest way to check if a server runs NCP is by using vanilla fly and flying away from the ground and seeing if it teleports you back to the ground.
- Can be checked for by typing /ncp, /ncp notify on, /ncp notify off or by typing /plugins and check for the message "You cannot use that"
